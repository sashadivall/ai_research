Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning,
and Machine Learning (ML). A survey of
multiple AI techniques, focusing heavily on

with interactive demonstrations, assess them
for equity and bias, and apply them in their
assignments. Techniques may be updated
as the fast-moving field of machine learning
evolves. This course does not go into extreme
depth on ML theory, instead focusing on how
to use these techniques to solve problems.

understand what Machine Learning is and
is not, and have a “utility belt” of skills and
conceptual understanding to allow them to
identify a problem, choose an AI technique,
and apply it effectively",Yes,Yes,"Technology has and will continue to drive
human advancement, but with advancement
comes questions that have no easy answers:
What is an ethical algorithm, and how can
we create them? What does it mean to
“own” something in the digital space? Who
(if anyone) ought to be responsible for the
content users post on social media platforms?
Who (if anyone) has an obligation to ensure
that technology is used properly? What
might it mean to use emerging technologies,
such as DNA testing, “responsibly”? How
ought we to go about answering these and
other questions, particularly when there is
no obviously morally correct answer? In this
course, students will consider some of the
ethical dilemmas that individuals, businesses,
and policy-makers will face in the wake
of technological advancements. Students

argumentation -the tools of philosophy -to
devise their own approach to answering
ethical questions about technology.",1.5,The course explicitly states that it does not go into extreme depth on ML theory and instead focuses on applications.,4.5,"Course 3 has a strong emphasis on applying ML techniques in assignments and problem-solving, indicating a high focus on application.",2.5,"Mentions assessing techniques for 'equity and bias,' suggesting some discussion of ethics, but the core focus remains on applying ML techniques.",3.5,"Course 3 raises valuable questions about technology ethics, including ethical AI, privacy, ownership, and content moderation, but lacks explicit discussion of fairness, accountability, or regulatory concerns.",3.5,Moderate depth.
